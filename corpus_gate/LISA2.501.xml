<Organization>TECHNICAL</Organization> DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF <Organization>PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV</Organization> SCREENS. <Organization>THIS</Organization> SITUATION HAS BOTH
PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OF
LOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF
