THE RELATIONSHIP <Organization>BETWEEN</Organization> <Organization>INFORMATION</Organization> AND DOCUMENTARY <Organization>INFORMATION</Organization>; THE 2ND

2 CHARACTERISTICS OF KIBBUTZ <Organization>LIBRARIES</Organization> ARE GIVING CAUSE FOR CONCERN;
DECENTRALISATION; AND THE <Organization>AVERAGE</Organization> <Organization>AGE</Organization> OF KIBBUTZ <Organization>LIBRARIANS</Organization>. DECENTRALISATION

INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED <Organization>BY</Organization> ANY <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization>, INCONVENIENCE OF
MANY READERS AND LACK OF A STRONG <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> THAT COULD BECOME A FOCAL POINT IN

THE <Organization>IMPLICATIONS</Organization> OF THE WORD &apos;<Organization>PUBLIC</Organization>&apos; MUST BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN

AND LEISURE MATERIAL. READERS DISLIKE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRIVIAL MATERIAL AS
