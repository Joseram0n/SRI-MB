FOR <Organization>GOOD</Organization> OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.

LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO <Organization>THEIR</Organization> RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHER
INVENTIVE NOR <Organization>INNOVATIVE</Organization>, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVEN
A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER <Organization>THEIR</Organization> OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD <Organization>ON</Organization> AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE <Organization>ITS</Organization> MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A <Organization>NATURAL</Organization> FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
<Organization>NOT</Organization> NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN
LOGIC.
