THE FIRST ISSUE OF 2SLJ&apos; <Organization>SOCIALIST</Organization> <Organization>LIBRARIANS</Organization> JOURNAL1 CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A
NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM <Organization>ON</Organization> LIBRARIANSHIP <Organization>FROM</Organization> A <Organization>SOCIALIST</Organization> VIEWPOINT,

OF THE RECENT <Organization>LITERATURE</Organization> <Organization>ON</Organization> <Organization>THIS</Organization> TOPIC, AND SUGGESTS THAT <Organization>LIBRARIES</Organization> MUST,
THROUGH FREE <Organization>ACCESS</Organization> AND UAP (<Organization>UNIVERSAL</Organization> AVAILABILITY OF PUBLICATIONS), ALLOW
EVERY THINKING PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN OPINION OF THE WORLD
AND THE SOCIETY ROUND THEM. WHILST 2SLJ1 LACKS INGENUITY AND IS OFTEN
INCOMPREHENSIBLE, IT ALSO FAILS TO INDICATE THAT SOCIALISM MUST REQUIRE A

<Organization>HAVE</Organization> BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY <Organization>HAVE</Organization>
NO <Organization>WAY</Organization> OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY <Organization>HAVE</Organization> CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN <Organization>OCCUPATIONAL GROUP</Organization>
UNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH <Organization>TRADITIONAL</Organization> <Organization>PROFESSIONAL</Organization> MEANS. BECAUSE OF <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization>
ASSOCIATIONS&apos; EMPHASIS <Organization>ON</Organization> THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION <Organization>ON</Organization>
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE <Organization>PROFESSIONAL</Organization> BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONS

MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.

<Organization>DIFFERENT</Organization> COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF <Organization>THESE</Organization> LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONE

THE SAME LANGUAGE <Organization>CAN</Organization> BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY <Organization>BY</Organization> 2 SUPPLIERS. <Organization>DIFFERENT</Organization>

WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.
     
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE <Organization>USE</Organization> OF <Organization>ON-LINE</Organization>
<Organization>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS</Organization> HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT <Organization>HAVE</Organization> BEEN
EXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE <Organization>USER</Organization> IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANY
DIVERSE <Organization>USER</Organization> INTERFACES. <Organization>SEVERAL</Organization> SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONE
WHICH IS REALLY OPEN <Organization>AT</Organization> PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO <Organization>USE</Organization> <Organization>ALL</Organization> <Organization>BUT</Organization> 1 OR 2 FAMILIAR
SYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT <Organization>SOME</Organization> POTENTIALLY VALUABLE <Organization>INFORMATION</Organization> WILL BE MISSED.
THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS <Organization>BY</Organization> <Organization>SYSTEM</Organization> OPERATORS
OR THE <Organization>USE</Organization> OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE <Organization>BETWEEN</Organization> THE <Organization>USER</Organization> AND THE
<Organization>RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS</Organization>. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENT
TERMINAL, <Organization>THIS</Organization> LATTER <Organization>ALTERNATIVE</Organization> BECOMES MORE <Organization>ATTRACTIVE</Organization> AND IT MAY APPEAR,
<Organization>AT</Organization> 1<Organization>ST</Organization> SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORE
LESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI <Organization>ON</Organization> OF STANDARDS
WILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS <Organization>IMPORTANT</Organization> IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BE
REALISED.
