<Organization>ON</Organization> <Organization>FINNISH</Organization> <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST <Organization>IMPORTANT</Organization> AREA
OF <Organization>ANY</Organization> <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> BUILDING, AS IN MANY <Organization>FINNISH</Organization> <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. <Organization>THIS</Organization> WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. <Organization>THIS</Organization> IS
NOT THE <Organization>WAY</Organization> TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION <Organization>BETWEEN</Organization> THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN <Organization>ONLY</Organization> BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS <Organization>COMPLETE</Organization>. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN <Organization>CAREFULLY</Organization> AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> <Organization>EXPERT</Organization> AND THE
