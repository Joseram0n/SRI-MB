THE FUTURE OF CATALOGERS AND CATALOGING.

CONTINUE, FUTURE EMPHASIS WILL BE <Organization>ON</Organization> THE SHARING OF <Organization>HIGH</Organization> QUALITY <Organization>BIBLIOGRAPHIC</Organization>
RECORDS THROUGH A <Organization>NATIONAL</Organization> NETWORK. AS THE AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL <Organization>CATALOGUING</Organization>
DECREASES, THE CATALOGUER OF THE FUTURE WILL MORE LIKELY BE A MANAGER WITH

<Organization>RESEARCH</Organization> INSTITUTIONS WILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL <Organization>CATALOGUING</Organization>
