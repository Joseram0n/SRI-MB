AN OVERVIEW IS GIVEN OF THE <Organization>BASIC</Organization> TYPES OF NOTATION THAT CAN BE DESIGNED.
INCLUDED ARE THE SEQUENTIAL (OR PURELY ORDINAL) NOTATIONS WITH HIERARCHICAL
LEVEL INDICATOR. IT IS SHOWN THAT LEFT ALIGNED SEQUENTIAL NOTATIONS ARE VERY
FLEXIBLE. THE EVALUATION OF NOTATIONS, CARRIED OUT WITH AN EXAMPLE, IS DONE
WITH A QUITE <Organization>COMPREHENSIVE</Organization> CATALOGUE OF DESIDERATA. FOR DESIGN DECISIONS, THE
METHODS OF WORTH ANALYSIS ARE RECOMMENDED, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING <Organization>WHETHER</Organization>
OR <Organization>NOT</Organization> TO EMPLOY NOTATION <Organization>AT</Organization> <Organization>ALL</Organization>. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS TO <Organization>USE</Organization> NOTATIONAL

ARE COMPARED, <Organization>THESE</Organization> JOURNALS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE FOR WHICH <Organization>PRICE DATA</Organization> ARE

HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF JOURNAL COLLECTIONS. THE NEED
