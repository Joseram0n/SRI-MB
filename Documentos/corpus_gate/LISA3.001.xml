THE ETHICS OF <Organization>FURTHER EDUCATION</Organization> LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE LIBRARIAN&apos;S &apos;CLIENTS&apos; IN THE <Organization>FURTHER EDUCATION</Organization> SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS
DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED <Organization>BY</Organization> THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
<Organization>SPECIAL</Organization> <Organization>REFERENCE</Organization> TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 <Organization>AGE GROUP</Organization>. THE NEED FOR THE
LIBRARIAN TO HOLD <Organization>THEIR</Organization> DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING <Organization>DEMANDS</Organization> IN BALANCE
IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES <Organization>PROFESSIONAL</Organization> AUTONOMY FOR <Organization>ITS</Organization>
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A <Organization>BALANCED</Organization> <Organization>USE</Organization> OF THE FACILITIES,
COVERAGE OF <Organization>SUBJECT</Organization> AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF
<Organization>FREE</Organization> ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT
THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN
RELATION TO <Organization>THIS</Organization> AND <Organization>OTHER</Organization> CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF <Organization>OPEN</Organization> <Organization>LEARNING</Organization> IS SEEN AS
DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL <Organization>COURAGE</Organization> IS

<Organization>SERIAL ACQUISITION</Organization> AS A CAPITAL BUDGETING PROBLEM.
     
EXAMINES THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PURCHASING PERIODICALS <Organization>ON</Organization> A 1-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> VERSUS A
3-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION</Organization> BASIS. THE <Organization>DECISION</Organization> PROBLEM IS VIEWED AS A CAPITAL
BUDGETING PROBLEM WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS COST MINIMISATION OVER A 6-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> <Organization>TIME</Organization>
SPAN. THE VARIABLES CONSIDERED <Organization>CRITICAL</Organization> TO THE <Organization>DECISION INCLUDE COST</Organization> OF
CAPITAL, <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION REORDER COST</Organization> FACING THE <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization>, ANNUAL RATE OF CHANGE
OF <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION</Organization> RATES, AND RATIO OF 3-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> TO 1-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION</Organization> COSTS. THE
MODEL WAS DEVELOPED AND APPLIED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF <Organization>LIBRARY</Organization> MANAGERS <Organization>AT</Organization> THE
UNIVERSITY OF <Location>ROCHESTER</Location>. RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT, EVEN UNDER THOSE
CONDITIONS MOST FAVOURABLE TO MAINTAINING A 1-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION</Organization> POLICY,
<Organization>SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS</Organization> CAN ACCRUE <Organization>BY</Organization> SHIFTING TO A 3-<Organization>YEAR</Organization> <Organization>SUBSCRIPTION</Organization> POLICY.

(<Organization>FROM</Organization> PRINTED TO <Organization>ON-LINE</Organization> DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE <Organization>FACT</Organization> THAT EXPENSES HAVE
INCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL OR

DECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVE
REMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE <Organization>ON-LINE</Organization> <Organization>FILE</Organization> HAS INCREASED
GREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A <Organization>BALANCED FINANCIAL</Organization> STATUS IN
